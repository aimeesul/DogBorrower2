## Information
This is a application made for the Mobile apps module as part of my final year for BSc(Hons) Computer science. This project is written in Swift. 

Initially this application was made in the DogBorrower repository. During the early stages of development, it became clear that the wrong project type had been chosen, so the decicion was made to start a new repository (DogBorrower2) and to copy over the code from the first reposiotry into the second. To see the first 9 commits please visit https://github.com/aimeesul/DogBorrower

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CODE IN THE DogBorrower2 REPOSIOTRY IS THE FINAL APPLICATION SUBMITTED FOR MARKING. THE DogBorrower REPOSIOTRY CONTAINS ONLY THE FIRST 9 COMMITS AND SHOULD NOT BE MARKED.
